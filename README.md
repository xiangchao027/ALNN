Trick-Free Net
# Network structures are driven by training data
1. It's a tree-like not stacked framework
2. Within each iteration, the structure will automatically change to achieve its internal optimization target: most energy saving structure.
3. Main idea: naturally organize input data into features(classification array).

TARGET: Getting rid of any tricks on building and training neural networks on any platforms and achieving almost the same
performance.
