Auto-Layout Neural Network
# Network layout structures are driven by training data
1. It's a tree framework, with fully connected network inside each branch
2. Within each iteration, the structure will automatically change to achieve its internal optimization target: most energy saving structure.
3. Main idea: naturally organize input data into features(classification array).
